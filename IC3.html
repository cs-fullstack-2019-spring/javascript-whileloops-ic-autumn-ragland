Create a hardcoded/fixed password.
Create a do-while loop that will ask the user to enter the correct password until it matches the hardcoded password.
Once they match alert the user THATâ€™S CORRECT!!!

<script>

    var pw = "yes";     //set the password as a string
    do
    {
        var input = prompt("What is your password?");   //prompt the user for input

    }
    while (input != pw);       //loop input as long as the input does not equal the password
    console.log("That's Correct")   //print confirmation when input does equal password

</script>
