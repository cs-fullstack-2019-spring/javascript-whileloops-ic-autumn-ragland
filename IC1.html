Write a While loop that counts down from 10 to 0. Once the counter reaches 0 log LIFTOFF!!! to the console
<script>

    var count = 10;     //assigning the first number of the count

    while (count <= 10 && count >=0)    //setting the parameters between 10 and 0
    {
        console.log(count);     //print the numbers
        count = count-1;        //decreasing value -> subtract from the number
    }
    console.log("lift off")     //once it reaches the lowest value in the parameters print phrase
